    "## Building a Self-Aware Classifier Using “IDK” Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus, in this notebook, we build an evaluation pipeline for generative models by combining a diffusion-based image generator with a self-aware MNIST classifier. Specifically, we first train an unconditionally guided UNet/DDPM model on the MNIST training dataset to generate handwritten digit images. This generative model follows the methodology introduced in the NVIDIA Generative AI with Diffusion Models course assessment [Generative AI with Diffusion Models](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+C-FX-08+V1) course assessment and the notebook prvided by the course intructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the quality of the generated images, we then load a multiclass MNIST classifier that was trained on a curated version of the MNIST dataset augmented with an additional `“IDK”` (I Don’t Know) label. During the construction of this dataset, samples belonging to the top **20% quantiles of hardness and mistakenness** were relabeled as `IDK`, encouraging the classifier to explicitly abstain from uncertain predictions rather than forcing a potentially unreliable class assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification makes the classifier more self-aware, allowing it to flag ambiguous or low-confidence inputs. Such predictions can be deferred to a human expert or used to analyze the aleatoric uncertainty present in both real and generated data. We then visually inspect the resulting predictions using the FiftyOne app. Finally, the test set—along with its predictions and associated metadata—is exported as a FiftyOne dataset, which serves as a structured evaluation resource for further qualitative and quantitative analysis of the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, we import modules and functions from our `src` package, set random seeds for reproducibility, and define the parameters and file paths used throughout the notebook."

The evaluation pipeline is fully encapsulated in the `Evaluator` class defined in `src/evaluation.py`.\n",

This function—defined in `src/utils.py` and adapted from the instructor's reference notebook—performs unconditional sampling while optionally extracting intermediate feature representations from the UNet bottleneck. Bottleneck embeddings are captured through a forward hook registered on the `down2` module and stored during a single forward pass at timestep $t = 0$, enabling analysis of the model’s representations in the next section. Generated images and corresponding embeddings are saved as `.png` and `.npy` files when a `results_dir` is specified.\n",

    "Because the generated images do not have ground-truth labels, we cannot compute strict accuracy. Instead, we perform a **qualitative evaluation** using the pretrained classifier: we examine the classifier’s predictions and associated confidence scores to see whether generated images are confidently recognized as digits or deferred to `IDK`. This provides insight into the realism and clarity of the generated digits, as well as the model’s uncertainty after having been trained on recognizing ambiguous cases.\n",
